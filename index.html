        <h1>Privacy Policy for Advisor Desk</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Advisor Desk</strong> ("the App"). Developed by Suvojeet Sengupta, the App is a professional tool designed to help customer care advisors track work performance, manage daily entries, and calculate earnings. Your privacy is fundamental to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, emphasizing that the App is designed to be a completely <span class="highlight">offline</span> tool.</p>
        <p>By using Advisor Desk, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>The data controller for the information you provide and manage within the App is you, the user. The developer, Suvojeet Sengupta, acts as the provider of the tool and does not have access to your data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Suvojeet Sengupta</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:suvojitsengupta21@gmail.com">suvojitsengupta21@gmail.com</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information We Handle (And What We Don't)</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Data You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
        <p>Advisor Desk processes information that you manually enter and manage. This data is essential for the App's functionality and is stored exclusively on your device. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Work Logs:</strong> Login duration (hours, minutes, seconds) and call counts.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) data (T2, B2, N counts) and Call Quality (CQ) scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Goals:</strong> Your self-defined monthly targets for calls and login hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Salary Parameters:</strong> Customizable settings for local salary calculation, such as rate per call, bonus amounts, and TDS rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2. Data We Explicitly DO NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>To ensure maximum privacy, Advisor Desk <strong>DOES NOT</strong> collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. We guarantee:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The App does not require you to sign up, log in, or create an account.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Identifiers:</strong> We do not ask for or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud or Server-Side Storage:</strong> Your data is never uploaded to any server. It remains in the App's private storage on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>No Third-Party Analytics:</strong> The App does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention</h2>
        <h3>4.1. Local Storage</h3>
        <p>All information you enter is stored in a local <span class="highlight">SQFlite database</span> within the App's sandboxed storage on your device. This means you have exclusive control over your data.</p>
        <h3>4.2. Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your data is directly tied to the security of your device. We recommend using device-level security features like a screen lock (PIN, password, or biometrics) and keeping your operating system updated.</p>
        <h3>4.3. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
        <p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as the App is installed. You can delete specific entries (Daily, CSAT, CQ) from within the App at any time. Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all of its data from your device, unless you have created a manual backup.</p>

        <h2>5. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>Advisor Desk is designed to be minimally intrusive. It may request the following permissions only when necessary for specific features initiated by you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage Access (Scoped or Legacy):</strong> This permission is required to allow you to save generated performance reports (in PDF or Excel format) to your device's storage and to use the database backup/restore feature. The App does not access any other files.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> The App may request permission to send local notifications to alert you when a report has been successfully downloaded to your device. These are not push notifications from a server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. How and Why Your Data Is Used</h2>
        <p>The data you provide is used exclusively to power the App's features on your device. The purposes are strictly functional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To calculate and display your monthly performance summaries.</li>
            <li>To automatically compute your estimated salary based on the parameters you set.</li>
            <li>To visualize your progress towards your personal monthly goals.</li>
            <li>To generate detailed PDF and Excel reports for your own records or for sharing.</li>
            <li>To enable you to back up and restore your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally, we do not have access to it and therefore cannot share or disclose it with any third party. Any sharing of data (e.g., an exported PDF report) is done voluntarily by you, the user, through your device's native sharing functionality.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Your Rights and Data Management</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Rectify:</strong> View, edit, and correct any entry you have made directly within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete individual entries or all entries for a specific date using the features provided in the App. To delete all data, you can clear the App's data in your device settings or uninstall the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Export your performance data at any time as a PDF or Excel file, or back up the entire database for your own use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Advisor Desk is intended for a professional audience and is not directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly handle any information from children.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App's functionality or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
