        <h3>3.2. Data We Explicitly DO NOT Collect</h3>
        <p>To ensure maximum privacy, Advisor Desk <strong>DOES NOT</strong> collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. We guarantee:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>No Personal Identifiers:</strong> We do not ask for or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud or Server-Side Storage:</strong> Your data is never uploaded to any server. It remains in the App's private storage on your device.</li>

        <h3>3.3. Google AdMob and Advertising</h3>
        <p>Advisor Desk uses Google AdMob, a mobile advertising platform provided by Google LLC. AdMob may collect and use certain information for advertising purposes, including displaying personalized ads. This information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Advertising ID (AD_ID)</li>
            <li>Information about your interactions with ads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Google uses this information to provide and improve its advertising services, including showing you more relevant ads. For more information on how Google AdMob collects and processes data, please review Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ads Settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a></p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention</h2>
        <h3>4.1. Local Storage</h3>
        <p>All information you enter is stored in a local <span class="highlight">SQFlite database</span> within the App's sandboxed storage on your device. This means you have exclusive control over your data.</p>
        <h3>4.2. Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your data is directly tied to the security of your device. We recommend using device-level security features like a screen lock (PIN, password, or biometrics) and keeping your operating system updated.</p>
        <h3>4.3. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
        <p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as the App is installed. You can delete specific entries (Daily, CSAT, CQ) from within the App at any time. Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all of its data from your device, unless you have created a manual backup.</p>

        <h2>5. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>Advisor Desk is designed to be minimally intrusive. It may request the following permissions only when necessary for specific features initiated by you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage Access (Scoped or Legacy):</strong> This permission is required to allow you to save generated performance reports (in PDF or Excel format) to your device's storage and to use the database backup/restore feature. The App does not access any other files.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> The App may request permission to send local notifications to alert you when a report has been successfully downloaded to your device. These are not push notifications from a server.</li>
            <li><strong>AD_ID Permission:</strong> On Android 13 (API level 33) and above, the App may request the AD_ID permission to access the advertising ID for advertising purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. How and Why Your Data Is Used</h2>
        <p>The data you provide is used exclusively to power the App's features on your device. The purposes are strictly functional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To calculate and display your monthly performance summaries.</li>
            <li>To automatically compute your estimated salary based on the parameters you set.</li>
            <li>To visualize your progress towards your personal monthly goals.</li>
            <li>To generate detailed PDF and Excel reports for your own records or for sharing.</li>
            <li>To enable you to back up and restore your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Advisor Desk does not share or disclose your voluntarily provided data with any third party, as all such data is stored locally on your device. Any sharing of your performance data (e.g., an exported PDF report) is done voluntarily by you, the user, through your device's native sharing functionality.</p>
        <p>However, as mentioned in Section 3.3, Google AdMob, the third-party advertising service integrated into the App, may collect and process certain data for advertising purposes. This data is collected and handled by Google AdMob according to its own privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h2>7.1. Google AdMob and Advertising</h2>

AdMob may collect and use certain information for advertising purposes, including displaying personalized ads. This information may include, but is not limited to, your device's advertising ID (AD_ID), IP address, and device type.</p>
        <p>Google uses the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. For more information on how Google AdMob handles data, please review Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by Google by visiting Google's Ads Settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">https://adssettings.google.com/</a></p>

            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete individual entries or all entries for a specific date (including Daily, CSAT, and CQ entries) using the features provided in the App. To delete all data, you can clear the App's data in your device settings or uninstall the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Export your performance data at any time as a PDF or Excel file, or back up the entire database for your own use.</li>
